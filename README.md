# This is my web dev project template script
I dont recommend using this since its not maintained like all of my other projects.

Run this using node.js

Dependencies:
  node.js
  next.js

### I didn't figure out a way to make it be executable from the repo so currently it only works if you download it locally and put it in your folder where you want it to make the project folder
example:
  Projects `folder`
  ├── my-next-app `folder`
  └── setup.js `script`
